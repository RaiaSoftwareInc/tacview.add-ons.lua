	Tacview 1.8.5 Lua General Interface
	Last update: 2020-09-29

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following features are available to general Lua modules in addition of the core features listed in [Tacview Lua Core Interface.txt]
Data importers and exporters DO NOT have access to any of the following features.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UI

	General functions to manipulate Tacview UI and aspect.

UI.EnterFullScreen() -- Tacview 1.7.2
UI.ExitFullScreen() -- Tacview 1.7.2

	Enter/exit full screen mode.
	When switched to full screen, Tacview displays only the 3D view in a borderless window.
	This can be useful during an online debriefing, so the user can fully focus his attention on the objects displayed in the 3D view.
	The user can manually switch between full screen and windowed mode by pressing [ALT] + [ENTER].
	It is also possible to exit the full screen mode by pressing [Esc].

UI.EnterReadMode( [borderless] ) -- Tacview 1.7.2
UI.ExitReadMode() -- Tacview 1.7.2

	Enter/exit read-mode.
	In read-mode Tacview displays only the 3D view (tools and menus are hidden).
	borderless is an optional boolean parameter which can be set to true if you also want to hide Tacview window border.
	This function is mainly to integrate Tacview window in another application when combined with UI.SetWindowParent()

UI.SetWindowParent( parentWindowhandle ) -- Tacview 1.7.2

	Attach Tacview main window to another application window.
	Typically used with UI.EnterReadMode(true) and UI.SetWindowPosition() to display Tacview inside another application.
	Call SetWindowParent(nil) to detach Tacview main window from your application.

UI.SetWindowPosition( x , y [, width , height] ) -- Tacview 1.7.2

	Change Tacview main window position and size when with and height are provided.
	Position is specified for the top/left corner of the window on the desktop, or in its parent window.

UI.SetWindowSize( width , height ) -- Tacview 1.7.2

	Change Tacview main window size.
	width and height must be > 0.

UI.GetWindowHandle() -- Tacview 1.7.5

	Returns Tacview main window handle.
	You can use this function to create child windows or dialog boxes for your add-on.
	DO NOT use this function to manually change Tacview window size, position or parent, in that case, use the dedicated functions which are doing more than just calling the OS.

	Return value:

		Tacview main window handle.
		This handle may be nil if Tacview is executed in silent mode with the command line.

UI.Update() -- Tacview 1.8.3

	Ask Tacview to update UI contant and to redraw the 3D view and all controls at the next opportunity.

	To save CPU/energy, Tacview pauses the 3D rendering when possible. In that case, you may want to call this method if you have added or significantly modified an object,
	and want to make sure that the changes are displayed in the 3D view.

	To maximize performance, the redraw may be asynchronous, i.e.: done at a later time, *not* when this method is called.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UI.MessageBox

	Message boxes can be used to display modal notifications and ask for simple questions to the user.
	It is suggested to not use too many message boxes as they are breaking the productivity flow of the user.
	Whenever possible, you can use the log to output most of you messages and rely on settings to choose the appropriate behavior depending on the circumstances.

UI.MessageBox.InputText( title , message , defaultValue ) -- Tacview 1.8.5

	Display a message box which wait for the user to answer a question by a text.

	Return value:

		Text typed by the user (an empty text is legal)
		nil if the user cancels the operation

	Example:

		local apiKey = Tacview.UI.MessageBox.InputText("Terrain Texture Downloader",
										"Please enter your Thunderforest API key.\n\nSee https://www.thunderforest.com/docs/apikeys/ for more details.",
										"abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234")

UI.MessageBox.GetOpenFileName( options ) -- Tacview 1.8.2

	Asks the user which file(s) he/she wants to load.

	options =
	{
		defaultFileExtension = defaultFileExtension,	-- excluding '.', for example "csv"
		fileName = defaultFileNameToSave,				-- (OPTIONAL) default full path or file name for the file to save
		multiSelection = false,							-- (OPTIONAL) set to true to enable multiple files selection

		fileTypeList =									-- List of file types supported for save (usually one item of the typical type)
		{
			{ extensions, description }					-- File type(s) and description {"*.jpg;*.png", "Picture"}
		}
	}

	Return value:

		list of file name(s) to load
		nil if the user has canceled the operation

	Example:

		local options =
		{
			defaultFileExtension = "csv",
			multiSelection = true,
			fileTypeList =
			{
				{ "*.csv" , "Comma-separated values"  }
				{ "*.xml" , "Extensible Markup Language" }
				{ "*.json;*.js" , "JavaScript Object Notation" }
			}
		}

UI.MessageBox.GetSaveFileName( options ) -- Tacview 1.8.0

	Asks the user which under which file name he/she wants to save a file.

	options =
	{

		fileName = defaultFileNameToSave,				-- (OPTIONAL) default full path or file name for the file to save

		fileTypeList =									-- List of file types supported for save (usually one item of the typical type)
		{
			{ extensions, description }					-- File type(s) and description {"*.jpg;*.png", "Picture"}
		}
	}

	Return value:

		full path of the file name to save
		nil if the user has canceled the operation

	Example:

		local options =
		{
			defaultFileExtension = "csv",
			fileTypeList =
			{
				{ "*.csv" , "Comma-separated values"  }
				{ "*.xml" , "Extensible Markup Language" }
				{ "*.json;*.js" , "JavaScript Object Notation" }
			}
		}

UI.MessageBox.GetFolderName( options ) -- Tacview 1.8.0

	Prompts the user to select a folder and retrieve selected folder full path.

	options =
	{
		folderName = defaultFolderNameToSelect,			-- (OPTIONAL) full path of the folder to select by default
		canCreateNewFolder = boolean,					-- (OPTIONAL) set to true to enable the user to create new folders
	}

	Return value:

		full path of the folder name
		nil if the user has canceled the operation

	Example:

		local options =
		{
			folderName = "C:/Downloads/",
			canCreateNewFolder = true,
		}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UI.Menus

	The Menu interface is useful to create and insert commands and options in Tacview menus.
	All new menus will be added to the addons menu.
	Tacview will automatically remove menu items of an addon which is unloaded.

UI.Menus.AddMenu( parentMenuId , textLabel ) -- Tacview 1.7.2

	Creates and inserts a menu in Tacview menu.
	You can specify the id of a parent menu, or you can use nil to insert your menu in Tacview addons main menu.

	Return value:

		a menu id (integer) which can be used late to insert sub items or to remove the menu.

UI.Menus.AddSeparator( parentMenuId ) -- Tacview 1.8.0

	Add a separator in the specified menu.
	Use separators to group options and commands to make your menus more intuitive for your users.

UI.Menus.AddCommand( parentMenuId , textLabel , function ) -- Tacview 1.7.2

	Insert a command in the given menu.
	You can specify the id of a parent menu, or you can use nil to insert your menu in Tacview addons main menu.
	function will be called whenever this very menu command has been clicked.

	Return value:

		a menu id (integer) which can be used late to insert sub items or to remove the menu.

UI.Menus.AddOption( parentMenuId , textLabel , optionBoolean , function ) -- Tacview 1.7.2
UI.Menus.AddExclusiveOption( parentMenuId , textLabel , optionBoolean , function ) -- Tacview 1.8.4

	Insert a command with a tick mark in the given menu.

	If optionBoolean is true, then a tick mark will be displayed next to the command label.
	You can specify the id of a parent menu, or you can use nil to insert your menu in Tacview addons main menu.
	function will be called whenever this menu option has been clicked.

	Exclusive options tick marks are displayed differently so the use knows that he can only make one choose amongst several.

	Return value:

		Menu id which can later be used to change the option value using UI.Menus.SetOption().

UI.Menus.SetOption( menuId , optionBoolean ) -- Tacview 1.7.2

	Change the value of a menu option.
	If optionBoolean is true, then a tick mark will be displayed next to the corresponding command label.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UI.Renderer

	The renderer is typically used to display objects in the main 3D view.
	NOTE: Drawing functions can be called *only* during draw events.
	See Events.* for how to register drawing callbacks.

UI.Renderer.GetWidth() -- Tacview 1.7.2

	Retrieve the renderer width in pixels or nil when not in a draw event.

UI.Renderer.GetHeight() -- Tacview 1.7.2

	Retrieve the renderer height in pixels or nil when not in a draw event.

UI.Renderer.LoadTexture( texturePath [, wrapRepeat [, compressed] ) -- Tacview 1.7.3
UI.Renderer.UnloadTexture( textureHandle ) -- Tacview 1.7.3

	wrapRepeat = must be set to true if you want the texture to be repeated (default = true)
	compressed = must be set to true if you want the texture to be compressed (recommended) (default = true)

	Load png or jpg file and compile it as a texture.
	Only 24-bit and 32-bit formats are supported.
	32-bit format can be used to draw translucent textures.

	Textures are directly used by UI.Renderer.CreateRenderState
	Textures are indirectly used (in render states) by UI.Renderer.DrawObjectVertexArray and UI.Renderer.DrawUIVertexArray
	Textures are automatically unloaded when the add-on is freed.

	Return value:

		The texture handle or nil if the file was not found or invalid.

UI.Renderer.CreateVertexArray( vertexArray ) -- Tacview 1.7.2
UI.Renderer.ReleaseVertexArray( vertexArrayHandle ) -- Tacview 1.7.2

	Vertex arrays are a list of 3D points used to display triangle strips, which in turn represent 3D objects on screen.
	Vertex arrays are automatically freed when the addon is unloaded.

	Typically:
		- You must call once (per 3D object) UI.Renderer.CreateVertexArray() to prepare your vertex array.
		- Then, in your Events.DrawOpaqueObjects() callback, you can use the handle returned by CreateVertexArray() to draw your object using UI.Renderer.DrawVertexArray().
		- Whenever the vertex array is not required anymore, you can release the associated resource by calling UI.Renderer.ReleaseVertexArray()

	vertexArray =
	{
		x, y, z,
		...
	}

	Return value:

		handle (interger) of the compiled array or nil if the array is invalid.

UI.Renderer.CreateTextureCoordinateArray( textureCoordinateArray ) -- Tacview 1.7.3
UI.Renderer.ReleaseTextureCoordinateArray( textureCoordinateArrayHandle ) -- Tacview 1.7.3

	Texture coordinate arrays are a list of 2D coordinates used to texture triangle strips.
	They are automatically freed when the addon is unloaded.

	textureCoordinateArray =
	{
		u, u,
		...
	}

	Return value:

		handle (interger) of the compiled array or nil if the array is invalid.

UI.Renderer.CreateRenderState( renderState ) -- Tacview 1.7.2
UI.Renderer.ReleaseRenderState( renderStateHandle ) -- Tacview 1.7.2

	The draw state describes constants which will be used for one or many draw calls.
	Typically used to specify a single color for a whole 3D model, as well as a list of textures used during draw operations.
	You can use at any time UI.Renderer.ReleaseRenderState() to free the resource associated to a previously compiled draw state.
	Draw states are automatically freed when the addon is unloaded.

	renderState =
	{
		-- OPTIONAL color (default to opaque white)
		-- Opaque red is: 0xff0000ff
		-- Opaque green is: 0xff00ff00
		-- Opaque blue is: 0xffff0000

		[color = 32_bit_rgba_color_code,]

		-- OPTIONAL texture loaded with UI.Renderer.LoadTexture()

		[texture = textureHandle,]

		-- OPTIONAL blend-mode (for transparent rendering phases)

		[
			blendMode =
				Tacview.UI.Renderer.BlendMode.Normal
				Tacview.UI.Renderer.BlendMode.Additive
		]
	}

	Return value:

		handle (integer) of the compiled state or nil if the array is invalid.

UI.Renderer.DrawLines( renderStateHandle , thickness , vertexArray ) -- Tacview 1.8.4
UI.Renderer.DrawLineStrip( renderStateHandle , thickness , vertexArray ) -- Tacview 1.8.4

	Draw the given lines or linestrip. Can be used during opaque and transparent rendering phase.
	Will work for both 2D and 3D rendering.

	For 3D rendering you can use Math.Vector.LongitudeLatitudeToCartesian() to convert latitude/longitude coordinates in cartesian (x,y,z) coordinates.

	Note that alpha channel of your colors and the blendMode of renderState will work only during the transparent phase.
	Textures are not supported.

	DrawLines will display independent lines listed in the vertex array which must have an even number of vertices.
	DrawLineStrip will display one strip starting at the first vertex up to the last vertex point.

	Thickness can be used to display thick lines. Its normal value is 1.

	You can optionally specify a rgba attribute per line:

	vertexArray =
	{
		{x, y, z},
		...
	}

	or

	vertexArray =
	{
		{x, y, z, rgba_color},
		...
	}

UI.Renderer.DrawObjectVertexArray( transform , renderStateHandle , vertexArrayHandle ) -- Tacview 1.7.2
UI.Renderer.DrawObjectVertexArray( transform , renderStateHandle , vertexArrayHandle [, textureCoordinateArrayHandle] ) -- Tacview 1.7.3

	renderStateHandle is an integer previously returned by UI.Renderer.CreateRanderState()
	vertexArrayHandle is an integer previously returned by UI.Renderer.CreateVertexArray()
	textureCoordinateArrayHandle is an optional integer previously returned by UI.Renderer.CreateTextureCoordinateArray()

	transform =
	{
		-- If the cartesian xyz position in the Earth global space is not provided, it will be calculated based on the spherical position (longitude, latitude, altitude).

		x = number,
		y = number,
		z = number,

		-- If the spherical position is not provided, it will be calculated based on xyz cartesian position.

		longitude = radian,
		latitude = radian,
		altitude = meters,

		-- Optional rotation info

		roll = radian,
		pitch = radian,
		yaw = radian,

		-- Optional scale

		scale = number
	}

	Draw the given 3D model (from a previous call to UI.Renderer.CreateVertexArray) using the given state (from a previous call to UI.Renderer.CreateRenderState) at the given position/rotation/scale in the 3D view.
	State and vertex array must be created only ONCE.
	DO NOT re-declare the state and/or the vertex array at each draw call, this will result in a resource leak.

UI.Renderer.DrawUIVertexArray( transform , renderStateHandle , vertexArrayHandle ) -- Tacview 1.7.2
UI.Renderer.DrawUIVertexArray( transform , renderStateHandle , vertexArrayHandle [, textureCoordinateArrayHandle] ) -- Tacview 1.7.3

	renderStateHandle is an integer previously returned by UI.Renderer.CreateRenderState()
	vertexArrayHandle is an integer previously returned by UI.Renderer.CreateVertexArray()
	textureCoordinateArrayHandle is an optional integer previously returned by UI.Renderer.CreateTextureCoordinateArray()

	transform =
	{
		-- Mandatory screen coordinates

		x = number,
		y = number,
		z = number,				-- 0 by default

		-- Optional orientation

		roll = radian,
		pitch = radian,
		yaw = radian,

		-- Optional uniform scale

		scale = number

		-- Optional non-uniform scale
		-- Tacview 1.8.0

		scaleX = number
		scaleY = number
	}

	During the UI pass, 2D coordinates are like the following:

	UI.Renderer.GetHeight()

	    ^
	    |transform.Y
	    |
	    |
	    |      transform.x
	    +------------------> UI.Renderer.GetWidth()
	   0,0

	Draw the given 2D/3D model (from a previous call to UI.Renderer.CreateVertexArray) using the given state (from a previous call to UI.Renderer.CreateRenderState()) at the given position/rotation/scale on top of the 3D view.
	State and vertex array must be created only ONCE.
	DO NOT re-declare the state and/or the vertex array at each draw call, this will result in a resource leak.

UI.Renderer.DrawOpaqueObject( objectHandle , transform [, alpha ]] ) -- Tacview 1.7.2
UI.Renderer.DrawTransparentObject( objectHandle , transform [, alpha ]] ) -- Tacview 1.7.2

	High level function to draw the opaque or transparent parts of the corresponding telemetry object in the 3D view.
	These functions will automatically use the current object shape and color to properly display the 3D model in the 3D view.

	UI.Renderer.DrawOpaqueObject() is typically called in Events.DrawOpaqueObjects callbacks to draw the main object body.
	UI.Renderer.DrawTransparentObject() is typically called in Events.DrawTransparentObjects callbacks to draw the remaining transparent parts of objects (e.g. properlters).

	transform =
	{
		-- If the spherical position in not provided, Tacview will use cartesian xyz position in the Earth global space

		x = number,
		y = number,
		z = number,

		-- Spherical position will be used in priority to render the object

		longitude = radian,
		latitude = radian,
		altitude = meters,

		-- Optional rotation info

		roll = radian,
		pitch = radian,
		yaw = radian,

		-- Optional scale

		scale = number
	}

	You can scale the object or set scale to -1 for automatic scale (depending on user settings)
	You can force the transparency of the object or set alpha to -1 for automatic (depending on dead/alive status)

UI.Renderer.Load3DModel( fileName ) -- Tacview 1.8.5

	Loads the specified 3D model in memory.

	transform =
	{
		-- If the spherical position in not provided, Tacview will use cartesian xyz position in the Earth global space

		x = number,
		y = number,
		z = number,

		-- Spherical position will be used in priority to render the object

		longitude = radian,
		latitude = radian,
		altitude = meters,

		-- Optional rotation info

		roll = radian,
		pitch = radian,
		yaw = radian,

		-- Optional scale

		scale = number
	}

	You can scale the object or set scale to -1 for automatic scale (depending on user settings)

	Note this is an asynchronous operation. If this is the first time, the model is requested,
	this function will return null until the model has been successfully loaded. So, you may want to retry the next frame.

	The 3D model is cached by Tacview and does not need to be freed.

	Return value:

		handle of the 3D model,
		or nil if the given file is still being loaded in background,
		or nil if the given file could not be found or loaded because of invalid format.

	Example:

		if not cockpitModel then
			cockpitModel = Tacview.UI.Renderer.Load3DModel( Tacview.AddOns.Current.GetPath() .. "f5-cockpit.obj" )
		end

		if cockpitModel then
			Tacview.UI.Renderer.Draw3DModel( cockpitModel , transform , color )
		end

UI.Renderer.Draw3DModel( modelHandle , transform , color ) -- Tacview 1.8.5

	Draw a 3D model previously loaded via Load3DModel().

	The model will be displayed in the one uniform 32-bit color provided. However, it will be shaded according to the default lightning so it will not appear flat.
	Textures are not supported, and normal maps are (re)calculated by Tacview on object load.

	Do not forget to properly set the alpha channel (0x00 = invisible, 0xff = opaque) to display the object either opaque or translucent.

	This function must be called only during rendering callbacks:
	 - Make sure you render opaque objects in your Events.DrawOpaqueObjects callback.
	 - And you render translucent objects in your Events.DrawTransparentObjects callback.

	Otherwise you will get waste performance in the best case, and display errors or artifacts in the worst case.

UI.Renderer.Print( transform , renderStateHandle , text ) -- Tacview 1.7.3

	Print the given text at the corresponding x,y coordinates.
	Should be used only during 2D transparent UI operations.

	You can set renderState.blendMode to Tacview.UI.Renderer.BlendMode.Additive to display HUD style text.

	transform =
	{
		-- If the cartesian xyz position in the Earth global space is not provided, it will be calculated based on the spherical position (longitude, latitude, altitude).

		x = number,
		y = number,

		-- Optional scale

		scale = number
	}

UI.Renderer.ContextMenu.RegisterListener( function ) -- Tacview 1.7.6

	Use this function to register a callback to add options to the context menu Tacview will display on right click in the 3D view.
	Right before displaying the 3D view context menu Tacview will call the following function so you can have the opportunity to add custom option:

		function( contextMenuId , objectHandle )

		-- contextMenuId (integer): Id of the context menu in which you can add options.
		-- objectHandle (integer): object associated to the context menu (0 if no object is related to the menu)

	Use UI.Menus functions with parentMenuId set to contextMenuID to add your own options to the context menu according to the selected object.
	The context menu is volatile and will be automatically destroyed as soon as it will be closed by the user.
	Every time your callback is called, your options will be added to a brand new menu.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Events

	You can register callbacks for different kind of events in Tacview.

Events.Update.RegisterListener( function ) -- Tacview 1.7.2

	Once a frame, Tacview will call your function which must match the following signature:

		Update( dt , absoluteTime )

			- dt is the number of seconds elapsed in real life since the last Update()
			- absoluteTime is the current telemetry time in seconds since 1970-01-01 (this parameter is useful to talk with the Telemetry module)

Events.DrawOpaqueObjects.RegisterListener( function ) -- Tacview 1.7.2
Events.DrawTransparentObjects.RegisterListener( function ) -- Tacview 1.7.2

	Once a frame, Tacview will call your function to draw 3D objects in the 3D view.
	There is one pass for the opaque 3D models and one pass for the transparent models.
	See UI.Renderer.DrawObjectVertexArray() and UI.Renderer.DrawOpaqueObject() to draw objects in the 3D world.

Events.DrawOpaqueUI.RegisterListener( function ) -- Tacview 1.7.2
Events.DrawTransparentUI.RegisterListener( function ) -- Tacview 1.7.2

	Once a frame, Tacview will call your function to draw 2D transparent foreground UI on top of the 3D view.
	You function will not receive any parameter.
	See UI.Renderer.DrawUIVertexArray() to draw your UI on top of the 3D view.

Events.PowerSave.RegisterListener( function ) -- Tacview 1.8.5

	Use this callback if you addon need several updates to complete a specific task.
	If your addon task needs at least another update to complete its job, you can return false, to prevent Tacview from idling.

	NOTE: This callback may never be called or be called at "random" times.
	Do not count on it to update data or to make any calculations. You must only return a status.
	Calculations must be made via the Events.Update() callback.

	WARNING: DO NOT abuse this function.
	Return false, only if necessary. For instance, whenever the user is waiting for the result of a calculation which takes several updates.
	If you abuse this feature, this will prevent Tacview from sleeping, and by doing so, this may put heavy load on one or several cores of the computer,
	depleting precious laptops batteries for nothing…

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Context

	This contains all the information relative the telemetry representation on screen.
	NOTE: See Lua Core Interface for additional functions.

Context.GetSelectedObject( objectIndex ) -- Tacview 1.7.2

	Retrieves the handle of one of the selected objects.
	objectIndex can be either 0 for the primary object or 1 for the secondary object.
	It is currently possible to select two objects at the same time.

Context.SetSelectedObject( objectIndex , objectHandle ) -- Tacview 1.7.2

	Choose which object is currently selected.
	objectIndex can be either 0 for the primary object or 1 for the secondary object.
	The user usually select object(s) to change the camera point-of-view or to define a specific context for some tools.
	To get an object handle from its telemetry id, use the function Telemetry.GetObjectHandle(id)

Context.GetActiveObjectList() -- Tacview 1.7.3

	Retrieve the handles of all currently active (alive) objects at the current playback time.
	The returned table contains the handles in no specific order.
	Returns an empty table if no objects are currently active.

	Return value:

		{ objectHandle1 , objectHandle2 , ... }

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Context.Camera

	The camera is used to define the user point-of-view in the 3D window of Tacview.

Context.Camera.GetMode() -- Tacview 1.7.2

	Returns the current camera mode.

	Return value:

		Camera.Cockpit
		Camera.External
		Camera.Satellite
		Camera.Free

Context.Camera.GetSphericalPosition() -- Tacview 1.8.5

	Retrieve current camera spherical position.

	Return value:

		{ longitude , latitude , altitude }

		Longitude & latitude are in radian,
		altitude is in meters above mean sea level.

Context.Camera.SetRotation( roll , pitch , yaw ) -- Tacview 1.8.0

	Orient the camera.

		roll: in radian, positive when banking to the right
		pitch: in radian, positive when climbing
		yaw: in radian, positive when turning to the right

	When "UI.View.Camera.Dogfight.Mode" == "LookAt" and "UI.View.Camera.Dogfight.Enabled" == true then the rotation is an offset relative to the target object.
	In other words, the rotation of (0,0,0) will point the camera toward the secondary object.

	If you want to look to the right of the targeted object, simply set the yaw of camera to +45 degrees:

		Tacview.Context.Camera.SetExternalViewRotation( 0 , 0 , math.rad(45) )

	NOTE: When the camera mode is switched, the rotation is usually reset.
	For that reason, you should change the rotation AFTER switching the camera to the mode of your choice.

Context.Camera.SetRangeToTarget( range ) -- Tacview 1.8.0

	Changes the distance between the camera and the observed object in external and satellite mode.
	The range is expressed in meters.
	In satellite mode, the range is relative to the mean sea level.

Context.Camera.SetOffset( offsetData ) -- Tacview 1.7.2

	Temporarily offset camera position and rotation.
	The offset is automatically reset at teach new frame when not overridden by an addon.

	The following components can be specified, all of them are optional:

	offsetData =
	{
		lateral = meters_positive_to_the_right ,
		longitudinal = meters_positive_forward ,
		vertical = meters_positive_up ,
		roll = radian ,
		pitch = radian ,
		yaw = radian ,
	}

Context.Camera.SetFieldOfView( radian ) -- Tacview 1.7.2

	Change the camera vertical field-of-view for one frame.
	The field-of-view is automatically reset at each new frame when not overridden by an addon.
	The default field-of-view is 60 degrees.
	NOTE: The field-of-view must be defined in radian.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Context.Playback

	Functions to control the playback of loaded telemetry data.

Context.Playback.Play() -- Tacview 1.7.6
Context.Playback.Pause() -- Tacview 1.7.6

	Resume / pause playback.

Context.Playback.IsPlaying() -- Tacview 1.7.6

	returns false if the playback is currently paused.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Media

	Functions to control synchronized audio/video media playback

Media.Load( playerId , fileName , absoluteTime ) -- Tacview 1.8.5

	Loads the specified media file in one of Tacview audio/video media player.

	playerId: Index of the player (0 to 3) where the media file must be loaded. This may replace any media previously loaded in the corresponding player.
	fileName: Full qualified path to the media file to be loaded.
	absoluteTime: Unix timestamp corresponding to the beginning of the media. Tacview will automatically synchronize the media playback with any telemetry data currently loaded.
