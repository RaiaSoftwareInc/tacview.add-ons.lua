# Over-G

## How to use it?

Then, simply enable and activate the add-on.

## Output

When any eligible aircraft goes over their assigned G-Limit, a voiceover will state "over-g" and a list of over-g aircraft will appear in the 3d view and in the log.

## Limitations

Eligible aircraft and their assigned g-limit are listed in the file limit-list.lua

If you add an aircraft be sure to use the short ICAO / NATO code of the aircraft (see as examples the aircraft already listed)
