# IL-2 Name Corrector

## Why was this add-on written?

In IL-2 the pilot name is appended to the aircraft name instead of being treated as its own piece of information. This limit's Tacview's ability to use the pilot's name.
The add-on will parse out the pilot's name and put it in the appropriate Tacview property.

## How to use it?

Activate the IL-2 Name Corrector by first enabling the add-on and then selecting "Automatically Fix Pilot Names". Now every time you load an IL-2 flight, the pilot name will be corrected automatically.

If you do not want this to be automatic, or if you want to correct the pilot names after the file has already been loaded, click on "Fix Pilot Names Now" for a one-time fix.  

## Limitations

* For IL-2 only.

* May fail if string of characters " - " exists in user's name or aircraft's name.

* Will not correct pilot names if pilot name exists already.

## Troubleshooting

Does the pilot name or aircraft name include the string of characters  " - "? This may cause this add-on to fail.
