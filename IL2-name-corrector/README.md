# IL-2 Name Corrector

## How to use it?

Activate the IL-2 Name Corrector by first enabling the add-on and then selecting "Automatically Fix Pilot Names". Now every time you load an IL-2 flight, the pilot name will be corrected automatically.

If you do not want this to be automatic, or if you want to correct the pilot names after the file has already been loaded, click on "Fix Pilot Names Now" for a one-time fix.  

## Limitations

* For IL-2 only.

* May fail if string of characters " - " exists in user's name or aircraft's name.

* Will not correct pilot names if pilot name exists already.

## Troubleshooting

Does the pilot name or aircraft name include the string of characters  " - "? This may cause this add-on to fail.
