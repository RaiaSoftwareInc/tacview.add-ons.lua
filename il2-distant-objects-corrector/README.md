# IL-2 Distant Objects Corrector

At one point, "distant" objects in IL-2 were displayed as red cubes to due export issues.

This add-on was written as a best effort to display the objects with whatever data was available.

It is our understanding that the issue has since been corrected so this add-on is no longer required. 

However we leave it here here for educational purposes.
