# IL-2 Off-Map Objects Corrector

## Why was this add-on written?

In IL-2 sometimes objects spawn off the map before transporting to their proper position, which is visible in Tacview.
This add-on removes an object's invalid position data so you get a clean debriefing.

## How to use it?

Activate the IL-2 Off-Map Object Corrector by first enabling the add-on and then selecting "Automatically Correct Off-Map Objects". Now every time you load an IL-2 flight, off-map objects will be corrected automatically.

If you do not want this to be automatic, or if you want to correct the off-map objects after the file has already been loaded, click on "Correct Off-Map Objects Now" for a one-time fix.  

## Limitations

* For IL-2 only.
