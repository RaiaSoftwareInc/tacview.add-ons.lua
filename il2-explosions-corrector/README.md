# IL-2 Explosions Corrector

## Why was this add-on written?

IL-2 uses lots of Explosions which sometimes block the view. This add-on makes the explosions disappear more quickly. 

## How to use it?

Activate the IL-2 Explosions Corrector by first enabling the add-on and then selecting "Automatically Correct Explosions". Now every time you load an IL-2 flight, the explosions will be corrected automatically.

If you do not want this to be automatic, or if you want to correct the off-map objects after the file has already been loaded, click on "Correct Explosions Now" for a one-time fix.  

## Limitations

* For IL-2 only.
