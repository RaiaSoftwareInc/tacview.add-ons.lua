# Auto Load Media Files

This add-on automatically loads media files corresponding to the primary and (optionally) secondary selected objects.

## How to use it?

Store your media files in the same folder as your .acmi files, following the file naming convention recommended below.

Load the ACMI file into Tacview and the media windows will automatically open and populate the relevant media files. 

## File Naming Conventions

The following naming convention is recommended:

<<callsign>> <<video-id-for-order>> <<date-time>>.mpg or
<<pilot>> <<video-id-for-order>> <<date-time>>.mpg or
<<name>> <<video-id-for-order>> <<date-time>>.mpg	(where name is the name of the aircraft as it appears in the ACMI file, such as "FA-18C_hornet")

For example:

MAVERICK 1 20210730T180000Z.mpg
MAVERICK 2 20210730T183000Z.mpg
BANDIT 1 20210730T183000Z.mpg
BANDIT 2 20210730T190000Z.mpg
BANDIT 3 20210730T181500Z.mpg
BANDIT 4 20210730T200000Z.mpg

## Limitations

# Up to 4 media files, in 4 separate windows, can be displayed per selected object.
