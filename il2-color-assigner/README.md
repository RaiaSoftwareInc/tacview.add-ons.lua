# IL-2 Color Assigner

## Why was this add-on written?

* When merging files, if different users chose different colors, the merged file may result in planes changing color mid-flight.

* In one case, using WWI aircraft, all the aircraft were assigned the color green by the IL-2 exporter.

The add-on will assign the following colors by coalition:

Allies/Entente = Blue
Axis/Central Powers = Red

## How to use it?

Activate the IL-2 Color Assigner by first enabling the add-on and then selecting "Automatically Assign Colors". Now every time you load an IL-2 flight, the colors will be corrected if necessary.

If you do not want this to be automatic, or if you want to correct the pilot names after the file has already been loaded, click on "Assign Colors Now" for a one-time fix.  

## Limitations

* For IL-2 only.

* If the coalition is not Allies, Entente, Axis or Central Powers, the add-on will ignore the entry.
