# Altitude Corrector

## How to use it?

The resolution of the terrain elevation data of Tacview might not match that of your file. 
This could cause objects to appear underground or ground objects such as vehciles and infantry members to appear to be floating in the air.

Load a file and click "Correct Altitudes" once to correct the altitudes of all objects throughout the entire file. 

Select "Correct Altitudes Automatically" if you would like the add-on to automatically correct every file you load into Tacview.

## Tips

* Make sure you are zoomed in as close as possible to the area you wish to correct. Zooming in closer will increase the resolution used by the add-on.
