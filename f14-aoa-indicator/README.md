# F-14 AOA Units indicator

If you fly F-14s in DCS World, this add-on is for you!
Use it to display in Tacview the F-14s own AOA indicator which displays AOA in units instead of degrees.
See [Heatblur F-14 Tomcat manual](http://www.heatblur.se/F-14Manual/cockpit.html#angle-of-attack-indicator).

## How to use it?

Install this add-on and replay your F-14 DCS World flight. In the 3D view a replica of the cockpitâ€™s AOA indicator will display the AOA in units.

## Limitations

Currently works only for DCS: F-14 Tomcat
This add-on could be extended in the future to support additional aircraft like the F-5.

## Troubleshooting

*No AOA indicator appearing?*

* Make sure you have an F-14 from DCS World selected as your primary object. 
* Make sure the add-on is enabled by clicking on Add-ons (Gear Icon) -> Enable/Disable Add-ons
* Make sure the add-on is active by verifying Add-ons (Gear Icon) -> Aoa Indicator -> Display AoA in Units (a check mark should appear; if you don't see any check mark click once to activate)
