# Exporter for HSIMRACING.COM Fan System

This add-on was created for the makers of the HSIMRACING.COM Fan System. 

When this add-on is enabled, it will send the speed of the main aircraft to any connected fan system driver, so that the fan speed may proportionally match the aircraft speed.

## How to use it?

* Launch real-time telemtry and connect it to your simulator. 
* MINIMIZE the Tacview window in order to conserve resources. 
* Enable the add-on via the Add-Ons menu and you should be good to go. 

## Limitations

Real-time telemetry is a Tacview Advanced feature.
