# Touchdown Velocity

Use this add-on with X-Plane and Microsoft Flight Simulator to display the touchdown velocity in the 3D view.   

## How to use it?

Select your desired primary object and observe in the 3D view that touchdown velocity is displayed at the moment of touchdown.

## Limitations

Currently this add-on works only with X-Plane and Microsoft Flight Simulator, for flights recorded with Tacview 1.9.5 beta 1 or later.

Touchdown velocity is calculated as velocity over 1 second previous to touchdown. Moment of touchdown is determed by an "On Ground" flag exported by the flight simulator.
