# IL-2 Arras Map Coordinates Corrector

At one point, export of the Arras map was incorrect because east and west coordinates were swapped.

This add-on was written to swap the east and west coordinates a second time, thus making them correct.

It is our understanding that the issue has since been resolved, so this add-on is no longer required. 

However we leave it here here for educational purposes.
