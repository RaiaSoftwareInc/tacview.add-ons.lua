# LightWave Exporter

This add-on exports currently select object position and rotation in a straightforward csv file which can be used to animate an aircraft in [LightWave](https://www.lightwave3d.com/).

## How to use it?

* Open in Tacview a telemetry file from [DCS World](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com) or [Falcon 4 BMS](https://www.benchmarksims.org/forum/)
* Select the object you want to export
* From the add-ons menu, select the frequency you want to export your data
* Enter the file name where you want to export the telemetry and click OK

If you donâ€™t get any error message, the csv file should now be ready to be imported in LightWave or any similar computer graphic software.

## Output

The csv file generated by this addon includes:
* Aircraft position (x, y, z) in meters, relative to the first position. Y is the altitude.
* Aircraft rotation (roll, pitch, yaw) in cumulative degrees (no wrap).
* One sample is generated per frame of animation, at the specified frequency (the frame number as well as the corresponding timestamp is stored for each entry).

## Limitations

Because it relies on the availability of native (flat) coordinates, this add-on currently works only with DCS World and Falcon 4 BMS telemetry data.

The code could be improved to generate flat-world coordinates (x,y,z) based on object longitude and latitude.
