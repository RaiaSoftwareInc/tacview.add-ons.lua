# Immersive Cockpit

In cockpit view, the aircraft 3D object will be displayed so proper visual cues are available to users.

You may add your desired aircraft to eligible-aircraft-list.lua and the asssociated .obj file to the add-on folder. Re-launch Tacview for the changes to take effect.

## How to use it?

With the add-on activated, and an aircraft selected, switch to Cockpit View (F5)

## Limitations

Currently works with T-38 object only - any aircraft will display T-38 object in Cockpit View when the add-on is activated.
