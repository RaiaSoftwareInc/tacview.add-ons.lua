# Force Labels

Tacview does not display labels on all objects at all times, in order not to clutter the 3D view.

Certain watercraft are considered low threat objects and thus labels are not always visible unless the camera is quite close.

This add-on forces labels to appear on all watercraft at all times.

## How to use it?

Simply select "Force Labels on Watercraft" from the submenu and observe that labels now appear on all watercraft. 

## Limitations

This add-on currently works on watercraft only. It can be expanded to include other kinds of objects if needed. 

The watercraft must contain the tag "Watercraft" in order for the add-on to identify it as such. See the documentation - https://www.tacview.net/documentation/acmi/en/ for more information about object types (a.k.a. tags). It is possible that a data source has not typed the object correctly in which case the add-on will fail to force a label.
