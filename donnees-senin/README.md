# Données SENIN

This add-on is developped for use by the French Navy in conjunction with the navigation software SENIN (Système d'Exploitation Navale des Informations Nautiques)

Data generated by SENIN is fed into Tacview for replay and telemetry analysis.

More about SENIN: http://www.netmarine.net/armes/senin/index.htm

## How to use it?

Export SENIN data in .txt files on your computer and use Tacview to open/merge them.

Use the file naming convention Classe(Trigramme)[Camp]_AAAAMMJJ_Exercice.txt 

Examples:

PA(CDG)[Blue]_20200402_ADEX461.txt
FDA(CHP)[Red]_20200227_ADEX472.txt

## Output

Tacview will display a 3D-replay of the recorded voyage along with raw and calculated telemetry information. 

## Limitations

Work only with data from SENIN.
